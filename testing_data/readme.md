# Test Data

Directory where scraped data from function calls are stored to allow for easier test case development.

## Warning

Must delete files inside directory if changes to main.py or the NASA api were made. This is because an instance of output is saved and any changes to the source code or database that can affect this instance require main.py to run again to generate an updated instance.
